CAIR is a mobile app meant to facilitate access to child-care services for families struggling with work-life balance. Given the current circumstances, the closure of schools and daycares has presented a challenge for many families as they struggle to tend to their children’s needs while also working remotely. As a response, there has been a rise in real-time virtual babysitting but we realize this may not be a feasible solution for families struggling financially. Our app is meant to be the “middle”-solution to the problem, providing a method to both monitor and entertain/distract children at home preventing the need for short-term supervision. The app will be accessible on all mobile platforms and start with a “Freemium” model, making it available for everyone.

The app's main features include:
* Monitoring: Facial tracking to notify parents via SMS when child leaves focal screen 
* Mini-Games: Variety of games to develop focus, spatial recognition and visual acuity, keeping kids engaged
* AI avatars: Customized responses based on a child's mood/facial expressions and ability to chat with the app's character
